Monk's best friend Micro's birthday is coming up. Micro likes Nice Strings very much, so Monk decided to gift him one. Monk is having N nice strings, so he'll choose one from those. But before he selects one, he need to know the Niceness value of all of those. Strings are arranged in an array A and the Niceness value of string at position is defined as the number of strings having position less than / which are lexicographicaly smaller than A[i]. Since nowadays, Monk is very busy with the Code Monk Series, he asked for your help. Note: Array's index starts from 1.
